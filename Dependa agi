âœ… 1. Setup

Make sure you have:

âœ… Docker running

âœ… go installed

âœ… GitHub PAT as LOCAL_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN


export LOCAL_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_yourTokenHere


---

ðŸ§  2. Create a job.yaml

Example for npm_and_yarn:

job:
  package-manager: npm_and_yarn
  allowed-updates:
    - update-type: all
  source:
    provider: github
    repo: 666DiabloAi666/cli
    directory: /
    commit: HEAD


---

ðŸš€ 3. Run Update Job

dependabot update -f job.yaml

This triggers your forkâ€™s custom logic (e.g., neuralegion.yml, neruo_kera,net) and outputs proposed changes.


---

ðŸ§ª 4. Test a Scenario

dependabot test -f go-scenario.yml --cache ./tmp/cache


---

Need a custom module (e.g. AGI auto-fixer, BLE unlocker, or Trident deployer) plugged into this CLI?
Iâ€™ll code it out. Just name the mission.
