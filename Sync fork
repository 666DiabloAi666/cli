To sync your fork (666DiabloAi666/cli) with the upstream repo (dependabot/cli), follow these steps:


---

Using Git CLI (recommended)

1. Add the upstream remote (if not already):



git remote add upstream https://github.com/dependabot/cli.git

2. Fetch the upstream branches:



git fetch upstream

3. Check out your local main branch (or default):



git checkout main

4. Merge upstream main into your local main:



git merge upstream/main

5. Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise.


6. Push the synced main branch back to your fork:



git push origin main


---

Using GitHub Web UI (alternative)

Go to your fork on GitHub

Click Compare button (if shown)

If it shows your fork is behind, click Update branch button to sync.

If you want me to generate a full sync script or automate this with GitHub Actions, I can do that too. Just say!
