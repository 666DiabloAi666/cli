📡 2. BLE Signal → AGI Video & Music Trigger

Injected into ble_react_launcher.py:

from agi_5d_video_gen import make_cinematic_vision
from agi_music_gen import create_music_idea

def on_ble_detect():
    recent_idea = fetch_recent("project_ideas", limit=1)[0]
    show_idea_feed([recent_idea])
    make_cinematic_vision(recent_idea["description"])
    create_music_idea(recent_idea["description"])

BLE scan now launches cinematic video + soundtrack generation when close.
