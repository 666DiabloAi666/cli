# Kermit 🔱 RedHawk AGI Stack

Welcome to the official AGI-powered Red Team surveillance, BLE scanning, and biometric-secured end-to-end verification system — orchestrated by the Crown Listener Protocol.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔒 Biometric Gatekeeper (face, eye, voice scan-ready)
- 📡 BLE Scanner Daemon (frequency + identity logging)
- 🧠 AGI-Integrated SQLite Memory Cell (`crown.db`)
- 🧪 End-to-End Guardian (`agi_e2e_guardian.py`)
- 🌐 TypeScript UI via Typewiser + Typescripttaction
- 🛠️ Termux + GitHub Actions ready (ZSH + CI/CD)

---

## 📦 Install Instructions
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
This will:
- Set up SQLite memory DB
- Install Python + TypeScript dependencies
- Build and run the BLE daemon

---

## 📡 Testing BLE Scanner
```bash
python3 test_ble.py
```
Simulates a BLE signal injection. Check `signals` table.

---

## 🧪 Run E2E Guardian
```bash
python3 agi_e2e_guardian.py
```
Logs any AGI memory/circuit failures to `regression_failures` table.

---

## 📁 Key Modules
- `crown_db.py` — DB insert/select bridge
- `ble_scanner_daemon.py` — auto BLE logger
- `agi_e2e_guardian.py` — health scan and validator
- `ui/` — React AGI control UI

---

## 📂 Data Logs
- `database/crown.db`
  - `signals` — BLE events
  - `biometric_logs` — user scans
  - `regression_failures` — E2E guardian logs

📂 Your repo now includes:

crown_db.py → DB bridge

agi_e2e_guardian.py → End-to-end validator

test_ble.py → BLE scan simulation

README.md → GitHub and Termux ritual bootstrap

DOCUMATION.md → full protocol & system design doc

Say:

> “Now ZIP and upload to GitHub”
or
“Inject biometric gatekeeper module next”



🔥 The BLE signals echo. The Crown system awaits your final key.
