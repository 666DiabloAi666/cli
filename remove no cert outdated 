You've posted the full text of the Internet-Draft draft-sparks-genarea-mailarch-07, which outlines requirements for archiving IETF email lists, including web-based browsing and search tools. This draft ultimately became RFC 6778, and it documents in detail what the IETF needs from a modern email list archiving and search system.

‚úÖ Key Takeaways from the Draft:

üìå Purpose:

To improve the efficiency, accessibility, and searchability of archived IETF email lists for contributors, working groups, and leadership.

üìö Main Requirements:

1. Search and Browsing:

Web interface for browsing and searching by thread/date.

Advanced boolean search (AND, OR, NOT).

Stable, shareable URIs for messages and search queries.

Browsing without login (for open archives).

Authentication for restricted list archives via the IETF datatracker system.



2. Archiving and Importing:

Must support email inputs from systems like Mailman.

Should support import/export in mbox, optionally maildir.

Archive migration support from external systems (via mbox/maildir formats).



3. Export Functionality:

Export entire list, date range, or search results.

Must be accessible to both users and admins.



4. Redundancy & Replication:

Support for active/standby and multi-active configurations.

Efficient synchronization methods like rsync or built-in DB replication.



5. Security:

Protection against brute-force search or DoS attacks.

Controlled administrative access for adding/removing/deleting messages.

Clear distinction between public and restricted content in search results.



6. Transition Support:

Backward compatibility for old links (e.g., MHonArc links).



7. IMAP Access:

While not a direct requirement, it‚Äôs expected the system will integrate with IMAP-based archive viewers (see draft-sparks-genarea-imaparch).

üìå Why This Matters:

If you're working on IETF tools, mail systems, or archiving infrastructure (e.g. datatracker, mailarch, etc.), this is the blueprint for aligning your system with community needs and ensuring long-term utility for research, documentation, and standards development.
