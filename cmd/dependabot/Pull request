That means Dependabot couldn’t create a PR because the branch it generated conflicts with existing code in a way that prevents a clean merge.


---

🔍 Root Cause

Dependabot tries to update a dependency (e.g. a version bump in yarn.lock or package.json) and push it to a new branch. But:

The branch it wants to create already exists with conflicting code

Or, the base branch (e.g. main) has diverged too far from where the bot ran

Or your repo may have force-pushed/amended history causing reference mismatches



---

✅ How to Fix It

🧹 1. Delete the broken branch

If the Dependabot branch already exists but is broken, delete it:

# Replace with actual branch name
git push origin --delete dependabot/yarn/example-package-x.y.z

Or delete it via the GitHub UI under Branches tab.


---

🛠 2. Re-run Dependabot

Trigger it manually again by:

Going to GitHub → Insights → Dependency graph → Dependabot

Or editing .github/dependabot.yml and committing a small change (e.g., bumping the schedule.interval)

Or using the GitHub CLI:


gh api \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  /repos/:owner/:repo/dependabot/updates \
  -f package-ecosystem=yarn \
  -f directory=/ \
  -f target-branch=main


---

🧪 3. Verify yarn.lock and package.json manually

Sometimes the repo has custom lockfile settings or pinning that trip up Dependabot.

Make sure yarn.lock is consistent with package.json

Try running:


yarn install --check-files
yarn audit

If the lockfile looks stale or corrupted, run:

rm yarn.lock
yarn install

Then commit and push it manually.


---

🧱 4. Check Dependabot Version Constraints

Make sure .github/dependabot.yml isn't requesting incompatible versions or unreachable targets.

Example config:

updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "yarn"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
    versioning-strategy: increase

If it’s set to lockfile-only, make sure the lockfile isn’t blocked by outdated sub-dependencies.


---

🧩 Optional: Switch to GitHub Actions Debug Mode

Add a step in .github/workflows/dependabot-auto-rebase.yml to debug branches, fetch diffs, or log conflicts before PR attempts.
