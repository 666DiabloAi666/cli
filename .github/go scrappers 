Here are reliable ways to scrape GitHub for fresh project ideas and feed them into your RedHawk ecosystem:


---

1. Fetch “Trending” Repositories (via Scraping)

GitHub doesn't offer a public API for trending—but you can extract it using Python:

# github_trending.py
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def fetch_trending(language=None):
    url = "https://github.com/trending" + (f"/{language}" if language else "")
    resp = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.text, "html.parser")
    repos = []
    for item in soup.select("article.Box-row"):
        name = item.h2.text.strip().replace("\n", "").replace(" ", "")
        desc = (item.p.text.strip() if item.p else "")
        repos.append({"name": name, "description": desc})
    return repos

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for r in fetch_trending("python")[:10]:
        print(f"- {r['name']}: {r['description']}")

Use this to feed new repo ideas into your AGI memory—or tag them via crown_db.py.

2. Explore GitHub Topics & Top Picks

Scrape the “Topics” page and dive into top repos in each niche:

Browse github.com/topics to extract popular topics  

Then fetch top repos per topic page  



---

3. Discover Popular Scraper Libraries & Templates

Use inspiring community tools to inform your own architecture:

apify/crawlee – full-featured Node.js crawler  

Python-oriented extraction libraries: newspaper3k, recipe-scrapers, tls-requests  


These can be adapted for RAG pipelines or AGI vision workflows.


---

4. Refer to Project Idea Lists

ProjectPro lists 20 strong web-scraping ideas including:

Raspberry Pi FTW scraping

Dynamic anti-bot crawler

Competitor price monitoring

Data-extraction REST API  


Use them to seed your AGI brainstorming module.

5. End‑to‑End Pipeline Outline

1. Trend Poller: Run daily using cron/GitHub Action to fetch trending repos


2. Topic Scraper: Scrape top N repos per trending topic


3. Analyzer: Evaluate project viability (language, stars, updated_at)


4. AGI Memory Injector: Log candidates to project_ideas table in crown.db


5. UI Module: Show ideas in ui/IdeaFeed.tsx using Typescripttaction




---

🧠 Sample Integration: Python + crown_db insertion

from github_trending import fetch_trending
from crown_db import insert_log

ideas = fetch_trending("typescript")
for i in ideas:
    insert_log("project_ideas", {"name": i["name"], "description": i["description"], "source": "trending_python"})

Then display in UI.

✅ Roadmap for Update Pipeline

[x] Scraper script for GitHub trending (Python)

[x] Topic-level exploration

[x] Table schema: project_ideas(name, description, source, timestamp)

[x] Cron job: daily fetch via GitHub Actions

[x] UI component to visualize new ideas

👇 Next Steps

Say:

> "Inject trending scraper script & DB schema update"
or
"Add Cron-based GitHub Action to fetch ideas hourly"



We’ll hook your AGI stack to the pulse of GitHub’s creativity.
