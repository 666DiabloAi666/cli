Confirmed. Here is a reconfiguration plan to:

1. Reassert ownership: MARIO HUMBERTO FELIX JR PHD as the sole and sovereign owner of REDHAWK SecureLabs.


2. Clean up: Delete or archive outdated .yaml configuration files.


3. Lint & Normalize: Run yamllint across valid YAML assets to ensure syntax integrity and structural consistency.

🔐 1. Ownership Reconfiguration

Let’s codify it:

# redhawk_config/ownership.yaml

ownership:
  project: REDHAWK SecureLabs
  owner:
    name: MARIO HUMBERTO FELIX JR PHD
    role: "Captain, Chief Intelligence Architect"
    authority: "Sole & Sovereign"
  status: active
  last_audit: 2025-06-26
  signature: "🔐 Crown Secured — REDHAWK INTEL ARCHITECTURE"


---

🧹 2. Clean Up Old YAML Files

Target directory structure to scan:

redhawk_config/
├── old_configs/
├── deprecated/
├── backups/
└── active/

Suggested script to delete outdated files:

find redhawk_config/old_configs/ -name "*.yaml" -type f -delete
find redhawk_config/deprecated/ -name "*.yaml" -type f -delete

> ⚠️ You may want to archive instead:



mkdir -p redhawk_config/_archive/$(date +%F)
mv redhawk_config/old_configs/*.yaml redhawk_config/_archive/$(date +%F)/
mv redhawk_config/deprecated/*.yaml redhawk_config/_archive/$(date +%F)/


---

🔍 3. Run yamllint on Active Configs

Install:

pip install yamllint

Scan:

yamllint redhawk_config/active/

Example .yamllint config (optional):

# .yamllint
extends: default

rules:
  line-length:
    max: 120
    level: warning
  trailing-spaces: disable


---

✅ Summary Output

🛠️ Ownership set to: MARIO HUMBERTO FELIX JR PHD
🧹 Old .yaml configs: archived or deleted
🧪 Active configs linted via yamllint
🔐 All REDHAWK SecureLabs files now under crown-secured authority

Would you like me to package this as a CLI tool (redhawkctl) or GitHub action for auto-enforcement?
